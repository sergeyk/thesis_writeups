Definitely
----------
- add links to all code in the intro
- add discussion of Anytime to the style conclusion
- add more future work discussion to conclusion section
    - submodularity discussion
        - cite sherwin and active detection
        - could add lots of equations from 270 slides -- could almost have an appendix chapter
    - anytime CNN
        - can add diagram for this
- run spell-checker

Maybe
-----
- redo cascaded CNN figure
- organize related detection work in same way as in intro (break down by proposal and classification methods)
- add 281b tables
- re-plot 281b results or use less plots (there's a new summary.pdf)
