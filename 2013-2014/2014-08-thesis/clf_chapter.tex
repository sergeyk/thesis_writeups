\chapter{Reinforcement Learning for Anytime Classification}

\PM{Motivation}
In the previous chapter, running a detector was a very costly action.
In other settings, such as classification problems, we may want to efficiently select a subset of fast features to compute.
For Anytime performance, we should be able to effectively classify any subset of features our policy selects.
